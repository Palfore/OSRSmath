/* This is the data file that the program will read.
	There are several things here:
		defenders:
			The set of opponents you will be fighting. It is best to do this by id since
			multiple opponents may have the same, but different stats. You can search by id here:
			ADD LINK!!!
			If you want to specify by name, its done so in a very similar format:
				arbitrary_label_for_your_reference: ["name", "Spider"]
		player_stats:
			You can specify as much or as few as you want. If it needs to know something
			like "can you wear a dragon pickaxe", it will ask you for your mining level.
		ignore:
			Some equipment in the cannot actually be wore in the main game, this lets you exclude those.
			Additionally, this considers EVERY equipment in the game. It's possible that you can't afford
			something, or don't want to get it (Fighter torso). The best way to do this is to run the algorithm,
			see if it spits out something you don't want, ignore it, and repeat.
		adjustments
		 	Some of the equipment data used is incorrectly recorded, or is hidden behind artificial quest requirements.
			Those are accounted for here. In addition, instead of ignoring something like barrows gloves, maybe you will
			get them when you have 60 combat stats, you can add this here. It is important that you add your particular
			ignores at the END of the list, so that it overwrites any of the other set adjustments.

	If you see/know about exceptions (things that should be ignored, or be adjusted) then please let me know.
